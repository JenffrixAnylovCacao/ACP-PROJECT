### These three program runs on its file itself because we make a three different programs for the three of us. The main feauture that will soon to be update is we will make a betting system on each game and compile it on one program.

1. Rock, Paper, Scissor(rps.py)
  - Rock, Paper, Scissors. The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players(one user, one computer) display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.

2. Guess the Number(gn.py)
  - Lets you pick a number between 0 to 36. Play the game to achieve true randomness and add the luck factor.

3. Coin Flip(cf.py)
  - Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands, in order to choose between two alternatives, heads or tails, sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties.
